They also monitor system dynamics at much higher frequencies as well as much lower frequencies than the fundamental components of voltage and current that are commonly monitored by synchro-phasor data analytics tools. Therefore, synchro-waveforms introduce a new frontier to advance power system situational awareness, system dynamics tracking, incipient fault detection and identification, condition monitoring, and so on.\n\nBy collecting data at a much higher reporting rate than synchro-phasors, synchro-waveforms create a new challenge in Big Data Analytics (BDA) in power systems.

Its main goals can be summarized as follows:\n1) discuss the latest progress on uncertainty modeling, forward and inverse uncertainty quantification and its associated techniques for decision-making under uncertainty in power systems;\n2) gather industry perspectives and provide solutions and recommendations to vendors, national labs, utilities, and ISOs in addressing the uncertainty for the enhancement of security and resiliency of electric power systems; and\n3) educate the next generation of power engineers for power system monitoring, operation, control, and planning applications and students in learning and using new tools.",
            "who-we-are": "Uncertainty quantification in modern power-system operation and planning is attracting the attention of power researchers due to an increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, the stochasticity of the loads, and the advent of demand response to price, among others. These uncertainties can lead to dramatic fluctuations in the system states that may jeopardize the system operation, protection, and planning. Thanks to a large deployment of advanced sensors and communication technologies, power engineers are improving the quantification of the uncertainties in power systems. Subsequently, the methodologies to handle these uncertainty are also in a booming period. New methods based on machine learning and statistical and applied mathematics have been developed, which rely on modern-computing technologies, such as HPC and GPU. Although increasing efforts have been made, the scalability, computing efficiency and the economic cost of the proposed solution methods call for further improvement. Motivated by these challenges, this TF has been set up with the aim to provide a systematically way to simulate, quantify, manage, and mitigate these uncertainties in power systems and to facilitate the uncertainty management for the power industry.",

Over the next few years, the computing industry is expecting GPUs and heterogeneous architectures to be the mainstream hardware. These new architectures have great potential in high-performance analyses of large-scale power systems. However, most power grid people have heard about GPU and FPGA, but not clear how to use it.

Within the framework of the so-called smart grid, many of these activities requires efficient solution of different types of optimization problems, whose mathematical complexity motivates further research and development on more powerful optimization methods.\n\nPioneer and recently introduced heuristic optimization methods are undergoing further extensions and developments by using novel high level mechanisms (metaheuristics) for improved search exploration and exploitation, including the possibility of using an ensemble of methods in a complementary manner (hybridization). Thus, the WGMHO will create task forces (TFs) to work on panels and tutorials on the application and benchmarking of these developments in all areas of the power and energy systems.\n\nAs an initial step, a special panel and competition was held at the 2014 IEEE PES General meeting, whose focus was on application of modern heuristic optimization methods for solving optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Guidelines and material related to the competition can be found here. Interested researchers are kindly encouraged to test their algorithms on the 2014 OPF test bed and to submit their results to J.L.RuedaTorres@tudelft.nl in case they beat the best results achieved so far.\n\nThis webpage is also intended to serve as a platform for dissemination of the activities of the WGMHO.

Grid planners, modeling experts, power electronics experts, and control experts will work together to achieve the following two outcomes: \n\nDevelop fundamental understanding on various possible IBR dynamics due to IBR and grid interactions. \n\nDevelop a set of tools to facilitate IBR planning model development and develop tutorials on how to use those tools.\n",

Active Circuit Planning is emerging as the center stage for distribution system planning.\n\nOn the system operations front, this Subcommittee disseminates information on what and how Distribution Management Systems (SCADA/DMS) systems in Distribution System Control Centers would be used to operate the distribution systems so as to meet the system operations objectives of high system reliability, environmental sustainability and operational efficiency, using application software such as Advanced Distribution Automation, Integrated Volt/Var Control, Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration, and Demand Response Management System, and the use of associated communications infrastructure.  Advanced Distribution Management Systems, which includes the integration of SCADA/DMS with Outage Management Systems, and its interfaces with Business Enterprise IT Systems (including Enterprise Service Bus [ESB], Geographic Information Systems [GIS], Advanced Metering Infrastructure [AMI], Mobile Workforce Management Systems [MFWM], Damage Assessment, etc.) using industry standards is an integral part of this Subcommittee\u2019s system operations front.\n\nSince distribution system business is undergoing significant changes, the Subcommittee also covers emerging topics related to distribution system planning and operations.  Such topics including Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS),  development of Sustainable Energy Communities in developing nations, Asset Management and Asset Condition Monitoring, and test distribution systems to facilitate planning and operations analysis of new technologies or engineering practices.\n",

Often overlooked is that there are as many as 100,000 people living on tribal lands in North, Central, and South America without electricity. This can stifle development and impede improvements in the quality of life. The purpose of this Task Force is to conduct research and engage in practical activities aimed at understanding and improving electricity access to homes, businesses, and communities on tribal lands. Secondary goals of the Task Force is to increase awareness and improve education on this topic, and to provide networking and community-building opportunities for students, practitioners, researchers, and the general public.\n\nResearch activities and outputs may include: review of state-of-the-art, collection of field data, synthesis of data, development of new technologies, dissemination of new research and data sets through publications, presentations and panels, and data sets. Other practical activities may include sharing best practices, creation and dissemination of load profiles and other data, and providing project specific advice. Outputs related to awareness, education and networking include: arranging and hosting webinars and presentations, uplifting voices from within affected tribal communities, offering tutorials, and arranging social interactions at IEEE PES meetings.\n\nWhenever possible, the activities and outputs of the Task Force shall be collaborative with local communities and seek to increase capacity among students, researchers, and practitioners that identify has having tribal heritage. The Task Force acknowledges the history of exploitive interactions with outside researchers, and will follow best-practices related to data sovereignty, energy sovereignty and human subjects research.",
